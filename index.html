    <h1>Yellowstone National Park</h1>
    <p>Yellowstone National Park, located in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, was established as the first national park in
        the United States. The park is a popular destination for visitors who enjoy ecological tourism as it offers
        forests, mountains, and abundant ecosystems to explore. Some of Yellowstone’s most well-known landmarks are its
        geothermal hot springs and geysers, the most famous of which is named Old Faithful.</p>
    <p>Last fall, Lisa and her friends decided to take a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park. They arranged to
        stay at one of the park’s many convenient campsites. For their camping trip, they brought their backpacks,
        sleeping bags, and a cooler of food and drinks. They pitched their tents immediately upon arriving to their
        campsite.</p>
